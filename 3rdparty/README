This is the third party dependencies directory for Code_TYMPAN 4.1.13

You need to download the archive Code_TYMPAN-4.1.13_third-party-NN.zip
from https://bitbucket.org/TYMPAN/code_tympan/downloads/ and uncompress
it in this directory (where NN is the version number of the archive,
currently NN=01) :

https://bitbucket.org/TYMPAN/code_tympan/downloads/Code_TYMPAN-4.1.13_third-party-01.zip

NB : The authenticatio use HTTP Digest Auth (which is broken in wget, 
     use curl --digest instead to download from command line).

This archive should contain :
 * an INSTALL file
 * a checksum.md5 to check the MD5 sum of each ZIP file
 * gtest-1.6.0.zip : the testing framework
 * dime-137851b034f6.zip: Dime library to read DXF files (i.e. AutoCAD files)
 * breathe-0.8 directory : source only documentation utility.
 * sphinx-extension-mathjax directory : documentation utility
                                        (for old sphinx versions)
 * NMPB2008.zip : the reference implementation for the NMPB2008 from CEREMA
                  (see Note 2 below : this is not publicly distributed for now)

Note about Dime: there is not tagged version. Thus, the name is followed by the
SHA1 of the changeset. For now, Logilab forked the Dime project on Bitbucket at
https://bitbucket.org/garaud/dime in order to write CMake files. Logilab asked
to the official project at https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/dime to apply these
modifications. We will updated this note and the related SHA1 when it is the
case.

Note about NMPB2008: because the upstream license and packaging for
the NMPB 2008 reference library from CEREMA is not yet fully polished,
the NMPB2008.zip archive is a custom Logilab package based upon the
distribNMPB2008_fromUpdate2013_11_13.zip official distribution and
derived from it with the authorization of the CEREMA. Work is in
progress to integrate required evolutions upstream. In the meantime
there will not be publicly available repository but the archive will
be included in the Code_TYMPAN-4.x.y_third-party-NN.zip archive.


Please note that the following major dependencies are not provided by
this archive as they are better installed in a system dependent way :
 * Qt >= 4.6
 * CMake >= 2.8
 * Boost >= 1.46
 * CGAL >= 4.1
